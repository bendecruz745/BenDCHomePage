        <h2>To Do List</h2>
      </a>
      <p>
        I've got to start somewhere, and what else other than a simple To Do
        list that makes me question myself?

        <h2>Weather App</h2>
      </a>
      <p>
        Weather App made using WeatherAPI's free API, got the data retrieval and
        overall functionally going pretty quickly, so I focused this time on
        making it prettier looking. CSS/Bootstrap may take a bit for me to
        learn...
